# Facebook API test

A simple client-side API test.

Test for login, logout and profile data retrieval (full name, profile picture, user ID).

NOTE: you need to supply a valid application ID - see fbtest.js line 68.

NOTE: when processing any user supplied data, always validate the user access token on server side! See https://stackoverflow.com/a/16092226/460571 for more info on how.
